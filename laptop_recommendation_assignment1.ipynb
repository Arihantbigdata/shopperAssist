      "    - The budget value must be **above or equal to 25,000 INR**. If the user provides a lower value:\n",
      "      - First, respond with: \"You will not get a hair straightener in this budget. Please increase your budget, and I will assist.\"\n",
      "      - If the user continues to provide a budget below 25,000 INR, respond with: \"We do not offer laptops in this price range.\"\n",
      "    \n",
      "    - Never assign values randomly. Always base them on the user's responses.\n",
